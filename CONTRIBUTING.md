# Contributing to Iron

**First and foremost, thank you for your interest!** If you are reading this then you are probably interested in programming language design, and perhaps the Iron language specifically. Either way, I think that is pretty cool.

At this point, Iron is just a personal side project I am building to learn more about compilers. If you are interested in working on it together, I'd start by joining the Discord community. That is where most of the discussion about the language will take place. As far as the actual code base, contributions are always welcome in the forms of issues and pull requests.
